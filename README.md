# Greed

To run locally:  

1) install node modules by running 'npm install'

2) run 'node server.js' or 'npm start'

3) go to localhost:8006/game

The rules of the game can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle

I have set up three instances of the game at the urls below. Only one game can be played at a time on each server.
